Recommended Practice and Study Approach:
Start with Easy topics to build your foundation.
Gradually move to Medium topics as you gain confidence and understanding.
Tackle Hard topics after you have a strong grasp of the easier ones and have practiced sufficiently.
Platforms for Practice:

LeetCode: Practice problems sorted by difficulty.
HackerRank: Problem-solving and contests.
GeeksforGeeks: Comprehensive tutorials and problems.
Codeforces: Competitive programming for all levels.
InterviewBit: Focused on placement preparation.
Books:

"Cracking the Coding Interview" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell
"Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen et al. (CLRS)
By covering these topics and practicing consistently, you'll be well-prepared for placements and will also gain mastery over DSA.
